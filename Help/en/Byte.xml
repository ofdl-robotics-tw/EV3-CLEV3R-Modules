        Manipulate individual bits of an 8-bit numerical quantity.
        This library lets you treat Small Basic numbers as if they were organized as 8-bit integer values (a.k.a. "bytes"). To do so, the parameter values are always converted to plain bytes, then the requested operation is performed and then the result is converted back to a Small Basic number.
        The usual bit operations are supported: AND, OR, NOT, XOR, various shifts and data conversion operations. Note that the identifiers AND and OR are reserved words of Small Basic and so these operations are named AND_ and OR_ instead. For further information see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation .

    <member name="M:ToLogic">
      <summary>
        Convert a number (can be a 8-bit byte or any other number) to a logic value of either "True" or "False".
        This value can then be used for the condition in If or While or any other purpose.
        Note that any input value greater than 0 results in a "True" while an input value of 0 or any negative value results in "False".
        This specific behaviour allows some weird and wonderful things to be done with this command. Refer to the appendix for advanced logic operations.
