+ addition
a = 2 + 1

- subtraction
a = 5 - 2

multiplication
a = 1 * 1

/ division
a = 10 / 2

= equal to
is used as an assignment operator
a = 2 (a is equal to 2)
or as a comparison operator
If a = 2 Then (if a is equal to 2, then)

++ increment
increase of variable value by 1
a++ (is equal to a = a + 1)

-- decrement
decrease of variable value by 1
a-- (is equal to a = a - 1)

+= assignment with addition
a += 2 (is equal to a = a + 2)

-= assignment with subtraction
a -= 5 (is equal to a = a - 5)

*= assignment with multiplication
a *= 4 (is equal to a = a * 4)

/= assignment with division
a /= b (is equal to a = a / b)

> greater than
If a > 2 Then (if a is greater than 2, then)

>= greater than or equal to
If a >= 2 Then (if a is greater than or equal to 2, then)

<= less than or equal to
If a <= 2 Then (if a is less than or equal to 2, then)

<> not equal to
If a <> 2 Then (if a is not equal to 2, then)

@ link to global variable
is used inside functions if you need to get the value of global variable from the main program without transferring it through input parameters
a = 10
Function Test()
  b = @a
EndFunction
(result b = 10)
