        Access sensors that are attached to the brick.
        To specify the sensor use the port number which is printed below the socket on the brick (for example 1).
        To access sensors of further bricks that are connected via daisy-chaining, use the next higher numbers instead (5 - 8 will access the sensors on the first daisy-chained brick, 9-12 the sensors on the next one and so on).
