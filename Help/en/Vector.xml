        This object allows direct manipulation of larger quantities of numbers. 
        These are called vectors and will be stored using arrays with consecutive indices (starting at 0).
        When arrays with different content are given to the operations, every missing array 
        element with be treated as being 0.

      <summary>
        Set up a vector of a given size with all elements set to the same value.
      </summary>
      <param name="size">Size of the vector</param>
      <param name="value">The value to use for all elements</param>
      <returns>The created vector</returns>

    <member name="M:Data">
      <summary>
        Set up a vector of a given size and initialize the elements with data drawn from a text. For this, the text will be split apart on blank spaces and every part is treated as a decimal number.
        For example: V = Vector.Data(4,"47 11 8 15") will result in an number array with the 4 values 47 11 8 15.
      </summary>
      <param name="size">Size of the resulting vector</param>
      <param name="data">Data in text form to be filled into the array. When the text contains too few elements, the vector is padded with 0 to reach the specified number of elements</param>
      <returns>The created vector</returns>

      <summary>
        Add two vectors by adding the individual elements (C[0]=A[0]+B[0], C[1]=A[1]+B[1]...)

    <member name="M:Sort">
      <summary>
        Sort the elements of a vector in increasing order.
      </summary>
      <param name="size">Number of elements to sort</param>
      <param name="A">The array containing the elements</param>
      <returns>A new vector with the elements in correct order</returns>

    <member name="M:Multiply">
      <summary>
        Matrix multiplication operation. 
        The input vectors are treated as two-dimensional matrices of given width and height. The individual rows of the matrix are stored inside the vectors directly one after the other.
      </summary>
      <param name="rows">Number of rows in the resulting output matrix</param>
      <param name="columns">Number of columns in the resulting output matrix</param>
      <param name="k">Number of columns in input matrix A and number of rows in input matrix B</param>
      <param name="A">A matrix of size rows * k</param>
      <param name="B">A matrix of size k * columns</param>
      <returns>A matrix holding the multiplication result</returns>
