This is a universal modules made by the OFDL team for [CLEV3R IDE (EV3 Basic Plus)](https://clev3r.ru/), which allows users to read information from various commonly used (Yuh I mean WRO and FLL :-D) sensors through the module.

Basiclly 90% of our OFDL EV3-G Blocks function has been convert to BASIC, the BASIC have faster speed (3x faster) to execute the program and reading sensor, with our modules can help you write BASIC faster and more conveniently.

## How to use?
1. Please download [CLEV3R IDE](https://clev3r.ru/), and extract to the path you want to save ( recommend C:\ or D:\ )
2. Copy the help folder(the one you download here) to the root directory of CLEV3R (the folder have Clever.exe) and replace the existing files/folder.
3. Run CLEV3R IDE and associate the file extension.
4. Open the Main_test.bp and have fun!

Notice: Unlike EV3-G blocks, when you need the module in your program, you need to copy the module folder (Sensors, Tool...etc) to your program path, of course you can just copy the module(bpm) you need.
